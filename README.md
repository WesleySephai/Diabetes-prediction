# Diabetes-prediction
Developing a machine learning model to detect diabetes


1. Load the dataset into your environment. [Read the date from the given csv file] 
2. Perform data cleaning and transformation as needed. [Handle null 
values, outliers, convert categorical features to numerical values]  
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets. 
4. Select and apply an appropriate machine learning model. 
5. Evaluate the model and fine-tune if necessary.
